# Description

This is a fullstack node application that involves the use of a mongoDB database, an express server, and HTML. The application involves the use of mongoose which behaves much like an ORM for a sql database. It is a budget tracker that keeps track of the funds you added and subtracted from your current budget. The user is allowed to create multiple transactions and will update the total budget based on the transactions. The application also has offline capabilities, it will update the front end using indexedDB to save the transactions to update the database when the application goes online again. 

# Installation

mongoose installation: <br>
